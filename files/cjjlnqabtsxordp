mobiReady </a> -
Free online mobile-friendly test tool from Afilias Technologies Ltd. The mobiReady 
score represents how well a particular webpage will do across the spectrum of 
mobile internet devices, with scoring between 0 (lowest) and 5 (best).  Low scoring 
web pages may be slow to load, of poor design or include components that will break the 
user experience on mobile devices.  Visualize site appearance on multiple device types; 
get detailed results and technical recommendations.  Based on W3C standards, as well as 
Yahoo's YSlow and Google's Page Speed guidelines. The set of tests evolves over time, 
to reflect new technologies and emerging best practices, so an untended site will likely 
experience a gradually declining score.  Registered users have access to their past test 
results, to monitor trends and improvements,  can download PDF reports of results, and have 
access to the mobiReady API for integrating scores into your own reporting and analytics.

Wraith </a> - 
Open source screenshot comparison tool, created by developers at BBC News, for regression testing

the affected areas are highlighted in blue.  Requires ImageMagick  and a headless browser.  
Takes screenshots of your webpages, runs a comparison task across them, outputs a diff PNG 
file comparing the two images and a data.txt file which contains the percentage of pixels that 
have changed, and packages all into a gallery.html, ready for review.  If any screenshot's diff 
is above the threshold specified in your configuration file, the task exits with a system error 
code (useful for CI).  The failed screenshot will also be highlighted in the gallery.

An automated testing service powered by machine intelligence, from mabl, Inc. 
Mabl can execute default tests that apply to most web sites/apps. To complete these tests, 
mabl only needs to know the URL and, if applicable, login credentials for the app.  The default 
tests are smart enough to figure out how to log in and traverse links for most applications.  
Beyond the default tests, mabl can be trained how to test an app using the Chrome 
Extension.  Mabl accesses your app via Chrome browser sessions running in compute containers 
and virtual machines hosted on cloud infrastructure.  It follows journeys to complete 
specific operations, captures the output, processes the results, and feeds information 
and insights back to you via the mabl application.   When you create an application, mabl adds 
two default journeys and corresponding plans automatically.   The first journey is a basic 
smoke test that visits the base URL of your environment and logs in, if applicable, and 
that journey is tested every 30 minutes or at every deployment to a particular environment.  
The second journey is a crawl through your entire application, following up to 50 layers 
of links within your domain.  Includes cross-browser testing, Salesforce testing capabilities, 
accessibility testing capabilities, PDF validation, email testing, API testing.

Open source update to the initial Selenium approach for driving browsers; has been integrated into

WebDriver uses whichever mechanism is most appropriate to control the browser.  For Firefox, it's implemented 
as an extension; for IE, it utilizes IE's Automation controls.  This alternative mechanism of controlling 
the browser allows working around the JavaScript security model browser restrictions.  Addtionally, where 
automation through the browser isn't enough, WebDriver can interact with the Operating System - such 
as in simulating typing at the OS level in Windows. Drivers available for most browsers. Can be controlled 
via C#, Python, Java, Ruby, Javascript (Node), and other languages.  Also see Selenium Grid

<p class="webtool">
<a href="https://github.com/chaijs/chai">
Chai </a> - 
Open source BDD/TDD assertion library for node and the browser for javascript testing frameworks.
Similar to Node's built-in assert; makes testing much easier by providing wide variety of 
assertions.  Has several interfaces that allow the developer to choose the most 
appropriate as needed. The chain-capable BDD styles provide an expressive language 
and readable style; the TDD assert style provides a more classical feel.

<p class="webtool">
<a href="https://cucumber.io/">
Cucumber </a> - 
Open source tool for executing plain-text functional descriptions as automated tests supporting 
BDD (Behavior-Driven Development). This means that the 'tests' (plain text feature 
descriptions with scenarios, written in the 'Gherkin' domain-specific language) are typically 
written before anything else and verified by business analysts, non-technical stakeholders, 
etc. The production code is then written outside-in, to make the stories pass.  Cucumber 
itself is written in Ruby (and also has implementations in Java, Groovy, Javascript, C++, etc.), 
but it can be used to 'test' code written in any language.  Cucumber Studio paid version available which
provides a collaborative environment designed for product owners and business analysts; enables 
publishing of Cucumber features as easily-readable documentation.

automated acceptance tests in order to make them easier to understand and maintain, and 
provides great reporting capabilties on top of tools like JBehave, Cucumber or JUnit. 
Also provides tight integration with WebDriver, to make automated web testing easier and 
more efficient.  Works in two ways: 1) instruments your test code and reports on the steps 
that your tests execute to achieve their goals, and stores the test results in a standardized 
format;(2) aggregates these test results into clear and meaningful reports, that reflect not 
only the outcomes of your tests, but also the status of your project. For example, you can 
get Serenity to report on what requirements, features or stories you have implemented, and 
how well (or not) they were tested.
